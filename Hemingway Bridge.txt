Trying to fix first-time-in issue, but encountered issue of phone not sending stop alarm signal more than one time.

Various headaches (most likely) related to instalation on new watch. Application context not updating on phone after watch sets time.

Installation issues solved; other issues better understood. We do not have a first-time-in issue, but something a little stranger. To have this app run properly:
    1. Set the alarm on your watch
    2. Hit stop alarm on the phone
    ~ next use ~
    3. Set the alarm on your watch
    4. Hit stop alarm on the phone
    5. Clear alarm state on the phone
    Repeat
So rather than there being a first-time-in issue, its like a every-other-time-in issue. Also, application context will stop being shared if you hit clear alarm before stop alarm, and you have to delete both instances of the app to fix this.
Feels good to know more about what is happening! Let's take a deeper dive into the code, though.

"Every-other-time-in" issue solved by adding timestamps and removing the unnecessary saving function on the phone.

Need to ensure alarm functionality. However, encountering strange delay between context updates and phone screen changes.

TODO: if we want to keep making this, we definitely need to ensure the sun/moon of the logo is disctinctly foreground (i.e. remove gradient shadow).
Previously mentioned "strange delay" has disappeared.
Fixed alarm scheduling issue by ensuring we set the date to be within the next 24 hours AFTER it's chosen

When the alarm gets triggered, "Alarm stopped" somehow gets printed from the watch.
When "Stop Alarm" is pressed on the phone, the alarm does not stop on the watch, but the screens change, showing successful communication but unsuccessful interpretation.
